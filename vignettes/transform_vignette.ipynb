    "The `transform` module of the `ah` package holds functions used to \"transform\" signal data into different forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "It includes the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **remove_overlaps**: Removes any pairs of repeats with the same length and annotation marker where at least one pair of repeats overlap in time\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\_\\_create_anno_remove_overlaps**: Marks rows of repeats with annotation markers for the start indices and zeroes otherwise. After removing the annotations that have overlaps, creates separate array for annotations with overlaps and annotations without overlaps. Finally, the annotation markers are checked and fixed if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\_\\_create_anno_rows**: Turns rows of repeats into marked rows with annotation markers for start indices and zeroes otherwise, then checks if the correct annotation markers were given and fixes the markers if necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\_\\_separate_anno_markers**: Expands vector of non-overlapping repeats into a matrix representation. The matrix representation is a visual record of where all of the repeats in a song start and end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As evidenced by the names, many of these functions overlap and perform similar tasks. In fact, except for remove_overlaps itself, all of the previous functions are called in remove_overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions in the `ah` package are meant to be used alongside other functions in the package, so many examples use multiple functions. In the examples below, the following functions from the [`utilities`](../ah/blob/master/aligned-hierarchies/utilities.py) module are called:\n",
    "- add_annotations\n",
    "- reconstruct_full_block\n",
    "\n",
    "For more in depth information on the function calls, an example function pipeline is shown below. Functions from the current module are shown in green.\n",
