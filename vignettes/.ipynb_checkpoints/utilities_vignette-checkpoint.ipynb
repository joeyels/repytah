This function is called after a matrix denoting the repeats is created by functions such as `find_complete_list`. Once a list of pairs of repeats is generated, `add_annotations` first creates a binary matrix that denotes each repeat. `__find_song_pattern` uses this information to create a single row in which entries represent a time step and the repeat group that time step is a member of. Then, annotation markers are added to pairs of repeats by looping over all possible repeat lengths in ascending order. For each repeat length, the annotations are added in another for loop, checking whether each repeat already has an anotation assigned. \n",
