    "The `transform` module of the `ah` package holds functions used to 'transform' signal data into different forms.\n",
    "It includes the following functions:\n",
    "- ____create_anno_rows__: annotates rows of repeats with annotation markers denoting the start indices and zeroes otherwise\n",
    "- ____create_anno_remove_overlaps__: annotates rows of repeats with annotation markers for start indices and zeroes otherwise; creates separate arrays for overlapping annotations and non-overlapping annotations\n",
    "- ____separate_anno_markers__: creates a matrix representation of starts and ends of non-overlapping repeats\n",
    "- __remove_overlaps__: removes pairs of repeats of the same length and annotation that overlap in time\n",
    "\n",
    "As evidenced by the names, many of these functions overlap and perform similar tasks. In fact, all of the previous functions are called in remove_overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions in the `ah` package are meant to be used alongside other functions in the package, so many examples use multiple functions. In the examples below, the following functions from other modules are called:\n",
    "- `add_annotations`\n",
    "- `find_song_pattern`\n",
    "- `reconstruct_full_block`\n",
    "\n",
