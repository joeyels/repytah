# ah package
This python package builds the Aligned Hierarchies for music-based data streams. For details on the aligned hierarchies, see [Aligned Hierarchies: A Multi-scale structure-based representation for music-based data streams](https://s18798.pcdn.co/ismir2016/wp-content/uploads/sites/2294/2016/07/020_Paper.pdf) by Kinnaird (ISMIR 2016).
## Elements of the package
* Aligned Hierarchies - This is the fundamental output of the package, of which derivatives can be built. The aligned hierarchies for a given music-based data stream is the collection of all possible **hierarchical** structure decompositions, **aligned** on a common time axis. To this end, we offer all possible structure decompositions in one cohesive object.
* Includes walk through file example.py using supplied input.csv
* _Forthcoming_ Distance metric between two aligned hierarchies
* _Forthcoming_ Aligned sub-Hierarchies - (AsH) - These are derivatives of the aligned hierarchies and are described in [Aligned sub-Hierarchies: a structure-based approach to the cover song task](http://ismir2018.ircam.fr/doc/pdfs/81_Paper.pdf)
* _Forthcoming_ Distance metric between two AsH representations
* _Forthcoming_ Start-End and S_NL diagrams
* _Forthcoming_ SuPP and MaPP representations
### Modules
* [Aligned Hierarchies](https://github.com/smith-tinkerlab/ah/tree/master/aligned-hierarchies)
* [example.py](https://github.com/smith-tinkerlab/ah/blob/master/aligned-hierarchies/example.py) - Includes a complete aligned hierarchies case in which a csv file with extracted features is input and the aligned  hierarchies are output.
* [utilities.py](https://github.com/smith-tinkerlab/ah/blob/master/aligned-hierarchies/utilities.py) - Includes utility functions that allow larger functions in other modules to function.
* [search.py](https://github.com/smith-tinkerlab/ah/blob/master/aligned-hierarchies/search.py) - Includes functions that find structures and information about those structures.
* [transform.py](https://github.com/smith-tinkerlab/ah/blob/master/aligned-hierarchies/transform.py) - Includes functions that transform inputs to be of use in larger functions in assemble.py.
* [assemble.py](https://github.com/smith-tinkerlab/ah/blob/master/aligned-hierarchies/assemble.py) - Includes functions that create the hierarchical structure and build the aligned hierarchies.
