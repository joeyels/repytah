# ah package

This python package builds the Aligned Hierarchies for music-based data streams. For details on the aligned hierarchies, see [Aligned Hierarchies: A Multi-scale structure-based representation for music-based data streams] (https://s18798.pcdn.co/ismir2016/wp-content/uploads/sites/2294/2016/07/020_Paper.pdf) by Kinnaird (ISMIR 2016).


## Elements of the package

* Aligned Hierarchies - This is the fundamental output of the package, of which derivatives can be built. The aligned hierarchies for a given music-based data stream is the collection of all possible **hierarchical** structure decompositions, **aligned** on a common time axis. To this end, we offer all possible structure decompositions in one cohesive object.
    * _Forthcoming_ Distance metric between two aligned hierarchies
* _Forthcoming_ Aligned sub-Hierarchies - (AsH) - These are derivatives of the aligned hierarchies and are described in [Aligned sub-Hierarchies: a structure-based approach to the cover song task] (http://ismir2018.ircam.fr/doc/pdfs/81_Paper.pdf)
    * _Forthcoming_ Distance metric between two AsH representations
* _Forthcoming_ Start-End and S_NL diagrams
* _Forthcoming_ SuPP and MaPP representations
