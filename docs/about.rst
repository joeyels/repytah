`repytah` is a Python package that builds aligned hierarchies, a representation for 
music-based data streams. 

Music-based data streams often have repeated elements that build on each other, creating hierarchies. 
Therefore, the goal of the Python package `repytah` is to extract these repetitions and their relationships 
to each other in order to form aligned hierarchies.
